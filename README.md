# SmartStats

SmartStats is a simple .log files analyzer. It is a PET project created due to specific requirements,
mostly for training purposes. It shouldn't be considered as a 'complete' tool for production use.

Features included:
- simple CLI for better user experience
- terminal-table wrapper around output stream for better presentation layer
- configured set of code analysis tools like:
  - reek for code smells detection
  - rubocop as a static code analyzer, based mostly on thoughtbot's configuration
  - codeclimate as an external service for code quality measurment

## Installation

Start with cloning this repo into location you like:

`git clone https://github.com/tchorzewski1991/smartstats`

Ensure you use version of [ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) which meets minimal requirements. It should be at
least `ruby-2.5.0`. This may be easily checked by any ruby version manager like
[rvm](https://rvm.io/).

```
rvm list rubies
=* ruby-2.5.0 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-2.5.1 [ x86_64 ]
   ruby-2.6.0 [ x86_64 ]
```

The easiest way to install `smartstats` locally will be through usage of [bundler](https://bundler.io/) gem.

Execute the following commands in order to install bundler:

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install


The last step refers to make `smartstats` executable useful. We can achieve this on two ways:
- install `smartstats` gem locally with [rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) by invoking `rake install`
- use [bundler](https://bundler.io/) with `bundle exec exe/smartstats`

## Usage

Installing `smartstats` gem locally is preferable. The `smartstats` gem provide simple and clean CLI
for better experience when parsing your .log files. To see all possible commands run simple:

```
smartstats
```

You should see output like the following:

```
Commands:
  smartstats help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command
  smartstats parse PATH      # Parses .log file under PATH and generates someuseful stats
  smartstats version         # Displays smartstats version
```

Above interface is pretty straight forward due to power of [thor](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor) gem.

Running smartstats command on .log file like this:

```
smartstats parse webserver.log
```

where given file contains following structure:

```
â”€$ cat webserver.log
/index 126.318.035.038
/index 126.318.035.038
/about 184.123.665.067
/index 126.318.035.039
/about 184.123.665.067
```

would report output similar to:

```
+--------------+------+
|     All Traces      |
+--------------+------+
| Uri          | Hits |
+--------------+------+
| /about       | 2    |
+--------------+------+
| /index       | 3    |
+--------------+------+
+--------------+------+
|     Uniq Traces     |
+--------------+------+
| Uri          | Hits |
+--------------+------+
| /about       | 1    |
+--------------+------+
| /index       | 2    |
+--------------+------+

```

All log 'traces' will be sorted by the given 'route' as well as grouped by the number of hits
encountered within that single route
